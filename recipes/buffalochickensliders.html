    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Buffalo chicken sliders are a delightful party favorite, thanks to their perfect blend of spiciness and creaminess. Made with Hawaiian sweet dinner rolls, these sliders feature a mixture of shredded Monterey Jack cheese, tender cooked chicken breast, cayenne pepper hot sauce, and ranch dressing. The chicken is first mixed with hot sauce and ranch dressing before being spread over the bottom half of the rolls and topped with more cheese. The slider assembly is completed by placing the top half of the rolls, brushing with melted butter, and sprinkling with dry ranch mix. These sliders are then baked until the cheese is melted and the tops are golden brown.</p>
    <p>To make the perfect Buffalo chicken sliders, start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and preparing the rolls by cutting them in half horizontally. After sprinkling the bottom half with cheese, spread the spicy chicken mixture evenly. Top with more cheese and place the top half of the rolls over the chicken. Brush the rolls with melted butter and sprinkle with the remaining dry ranch mix before baking. For an extra touch, you can serve these sliders with a side of coleslaw or make them ahead of time by preparing the chicken mixture up to three days in advance. Just remember to reheat the chicken mixture before assembling and baking. These sliders are sure to be a hit at your next gathering!</p>
