    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Craving a touch of pub-inspired goodness at home? This Buffalo Chicken Pizza, a fan favorite from a local sports pub, offers a bold twist on your usual pie. Made with a store-bought prebaked pizza crust, it's topped with tangy Buffalo wing sauce, tender diced chicken breast, and crumbled blue cheese. The addition of thinly sliced celery provides a satisfying crunch, all held together by gooey, melted mozzarella cheese. Perfect for a game day appetizer, simply bake it to bubbly perfection, cut into squares, and serve with ranch dressing, celery, and carrot sticks on the side for an authentic touch.</p>
    <p>Preparation is a breeze with just a few steps: preheat your oven, line a baking sheet with foil, and layer on the flavorful ingredients. The chicken is first mixed with a bit of wing sauce, then spread over the crust along with more sauce, blue cheese, and celery, finally covered with a generous helping of mozzarella. After a quick 12-minute bake, you'll have a rich, savory treat that's best enjoyed hot and fresh from the oven. Whether for a casual get-together or a fun family night, this pizza is sure to be a hit. </p>
